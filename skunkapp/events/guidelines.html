        <h1>SkunkApp's Events Community Guidelines</h1>

        <p>Welcome to SkunkApp’s event community! SkunkApp is dedicated to providing a respectful and enjoyable space for users to create, host, and attend events of various kinds. To keep our community safe and inclusive, we have established the following guidelines. Please read these carefully before engaging in any event activities, as your use of SkunkApp implies agreement to adhere to these guidelines.</p>

        <h2>1. Event Creation Guidelines</h2>
        <p>These guidelines apply to all users who create events on SkunkApp. We expect event creators to follow these standards to ensure a consistent, welcoming, and appropriate environment for all participants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Clear and Accurate Information</strong>: Each event listing should include an accurate and informative title, description, start and end times, and relevant details such as location, required materials, or special instructions. Ensure all information is current and free from errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Appropriate Thumbnails and Media</strong>: The image or thumbnail associated with your event should reflect the nature of the event in a tasteful and respectful manner. Refrain from using any content that is offensive, explicit, or copyrighted without proper permission. Non-compliant images will lead to event removal and potential penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>URL Links and Attachments</strong>: If your event requires links to external sites or resources, make sure these links are trustworthy, accurate, and relevant. Links to inappropriate or unsafe content are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate removal of the event along with possible account suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Review and Approval</strong>: Some events may require moderator approval prior to going live on SkunkApp. If your event falls under this category, please allow up to 24 hours for the review process. Pending events should not be duplicated during the wait period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Event Moderation</h2>
        <p>SkunkApp moderators are responsible for overseeing event listings and ensuring that all events comply with these guidelines. Please respect their decisions, as they are in place to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respect Moderator Decisions</strong>: Moderators have the authority to approve, reject, or delete events if they do not comply with SkunkApp's standards. This includes evaluating event content, thumbnails, descriptions, and any attached links for appropriateness and relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Image and Thumbnail Moderation</strong>: Event images and thumbnails are subject to review. If an image is deemed inappropriate, the event creator will be notified and given a chance to replace the image with an appropriate alternative.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Deletion and Notifications</strong>: Events that violate guidelines may be removed without prior notice. However, the event creator will typically be informed of the reason for removal when possible. Repeated violations may lead to account restrictions or suspension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Event Participation</h2>
        <p>By participating in SkunkApp events, users agree to engage respectfully and follow the guidelines below. Event participants are expected to create a positive experience for all attendees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Respectful Interactions</strong>: All interactions during an event, including comments, questions, and discussions, should remain respectful and constructive. Harassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated and may result in removal from the event or further disciplinary action.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay on Topic</strong>: Event discussions should remain relevant to the topic at hand. Off-topic comments, disruptive behavior, or any other actions that detract from the event’s focus may lead to removal from the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Inappropriate Content</strong>: If you observe any content or behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it to a moderator immediately. SkunkApp takes user reports seriously and will address concerns promptly to ensure a safe environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. General Conduct</h2>
        <p>All SkunkApp users are expected to uphold a high standard of conduct both within and outside of specific events. This section includes additional guidelines for maintaining a positive community atmosphere.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoid Spamming and Self-Promotion</strong>: SkunkApp does not permit spam or self-promotional posts that are not explicitly permitted by event creators. Self-promotion in event chats, discussions, or media is allowed only if clearly related to the event and permitted by the host.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect Privacy and Safety</strong>: For privacy and security reasons, do not share personal information such as your phone number, address, or other sensitive details in event chats or media. Protect your own privacy and respect others’ right to privacy as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Contributions</strong>: Use SkunkApp as a platform to share knowledge, make connections, and engage positively. Refrain from behavior that disrupts events or diminishes the experience for other participants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Enforcement and Penalties</h2>
        <p>Violations of these guidelines may result in a range of penalties based on the severity and frequency of the infractions. SkunkApp reserves the right to enforce these measures to maintain the community’s integrity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warnings and Event Removals</strong>: Minor infractions may result in a warning or a temporary restriction, whereas serious or repeated violations may lead to event removal or account suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary or Permanent Suspension</strong>: For severe infractions, SkunkApp may temporarily or permanently suspend a user’s account. This is typically reserved for cases involving serious harassment, discrimination, or repeated guideline violations.</li>
            <li><strong>Appeal Process</strong>: If you believe an action taken against your account was unjust, you may file an appeal through SkunkApp’s support channels. Our support team will review your case and make a determination. Appeals should be made within 14 days of receiving a penalty notice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Event Thumbnail Review and Spam Guidelines</h2>
        <p>These additional guidelines specify restrictions on thumbnails used for events and the handling of spam-related content to maintain a clean and respectful platform.</p>

        <h3>Event Thumbnail Review</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sexual Content:</strong> Forbidden. Thumbnails must not contain any explicit or sexually suggestive material.</li>
            <li><strong>Nudity:</strong> Forbidden. Thumbnails must avoid any form of nudity to ensure a family-friendly environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Gore:</strong> Forbidden. Violent, graphic, or gory images are not allowed.</li>
            <li><strong>Scams:</strong> Forbidden. Thumbnails must not contain misleading or fraudulent content.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Forbidden to use ads in events. Thumbnails should not serve as promotional ads unrelated to the event content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Event Spam Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spam:</strong> Forbidden. Any repetitive, irrelevant, or unwanted content in event descriptions or discussions is prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Spam Thumbnail Reviews:</strong> Forbidden. Thumbnails designed to deceive, mislead, or clutter event listings are not allowed.</li>
        </ul>
