    <h1>SkunkApp's Events Guidelines</h1>

    <p>Welcome to SkunkApp’s event community! To maintain a respectful and enjoyable environment, we’ve set the following guidelines for creating, moderating, and participating in events. Please read carefully before engaging in any event activities.</p>

    <h2>1. Event Creation Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear and Accurate Information</strong>: Ensure event names, descriptions, start/end times, and other details are accurate and clear.</li>
        <li><strong>Thumbnail and Media</strong>: Event thumbnails should be appropriate and relevant to the event. Avoid using explicit, offensive, or copyrighted content without permission.</li>
        <li><strong>URL Links</strong>: If an event requires a link, ensure it’s safe, accurate, and relevant. Links to inappropriate content will result in event removal and potential account suspension.</li>
        <li><strong>Pending Approval</strong>: Some events may require moderator approval before going live. If your event is pending, please be patient, as approval may take up to 24 hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Event Moderation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect Moderator Decisions</strong>: Moderators have the authority to approve, reject, or delete events as necessary to maintain community standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Thumbnail Moderation</strong>: Thumbnails may be reviewed for appropriateness. If rejected, you may resubmit with suitable changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Deletion</strong>: Events violating guidelines may be removed without prior warning. The creator will be notified with a reason if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Event Participation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Respectful</strong>: Treat all event participants with respect. Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behavior is strictly prohibited.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay on Topic</strong>: Ensure your interactions are relevant to the event at hand. Off-topic or disruptive behavior may result in removal from the event.</li>
        <li><strong>Report Issues</strong>: If you encounter any inappropriate content or behavior, report it to a moderator for review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. General Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Spam or Self-Promotion</strong>: Avoid spamming events or using them solely for self-promotion unless explicitly permitted by the event creator.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy and Safety</strong>: Do not share personal information in event chat or media. Keep conversations safe and relevant to the event theme.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Enforcement and Penalties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Warnings and Penalties</strong>: Users violating these guidelines may receive a warning, have their events removed, or face suspension from SkunkApp depending on the severity of the offense.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeal Process</strong>: If you feel a decision was made in error, you may reach out to support for review.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By creating or participating in an event on SkunkApp, you agree to adhere to these guidelines. Thank you for helping us keep SkunkApp’s community safe, enjoyable, and inclusive!</p>
